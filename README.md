# D&D Obsidian Reference

A script to break down the excellent compiled
[D&D SRD Remastered](https://github.com/Umbyology/OGL-SRD5) into a workable
reference directory for use in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

## Get the files

You probably just want the end result! Head to the
[releases](https://github.com/twisterghost/5e-obsidian/releases) page of this
repo and download the latest .zip. Unzip it and add it to your Obsidian vault
and you're ready to roll.

## Build it yourself

If you'd rather play with the code or build the output resources yourself,
you can start by cloning this repository:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/twisterghost/5e-obsidian.git
```

Then, install dependencies and run:

```shell
$ cd 5e-obisidian
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

By default, the resources will compile to a directory called `resource`.
